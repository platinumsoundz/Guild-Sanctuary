# The Sanctuary — Roadmap

Last updated: 2026-10-27

Status reconciliation: this update corrects stale theme/notification labels from repository and coordination evidence. It does not claim browser QA, migration application, or production deployment.

Owner: product owner (Ashley)
Status: planning document. Nothing here is built unless it says so.

This is the single product roadmap for The Sanctuary. `MASTER_BLUEPRINT.md` records implementation state; `AI_RESTORE_PROMPT.md` is the session handoff. The current database migration inventory is recorded in `docs/SUPABASE_MIGRATION_DRIFT_INVENTORY_2026-10-26.md`. Keep these sources aligned when a decision or status changes.

Status labels used below:

- **Idea** — discussed, not designed.
- **Planned** — agreed direction, no code.
- **In code** — implemented in the repository.
- **Unapplied** — code exists but its SQL/functions are not applied or deployed.
- **Verified** — actually tested against a named staging/production build, with evidence recorded. Do not infer verification from source code or a successful build.
- **Deferred** — deliberately postponed.
- **Rejected** — decided against; do not reintroduce without the owner.

## 1. Identity and naming

- The product is **The Sanctuary**. It is no longer "Guild Sanctuary" or
  "The Guild Sanctuary".
- Retire "Guild" from user-facing copy, docs headings, and the app shell. The
  GitHub repository name (`Guild-Sanctuary`) and the Android application ID
  (`com.guildsanctuary.app`) stay for now: changing the app ID breaks installed
  builds and store identity, and the repository name is not user-facing.
- Current shell inspection (2026-10-27):
  - `src/components/ResponsiveShell.tsx` currently renders the install banner
    above the app stage; it does **not** contain a `GUILD / SANCTUARY` title or
    `G` brand mark in the checked-in main revision. The install banner has an
    Install action and a dismiss button that persists the choice in local
    storage.
  - The theme foundation from PR #69 is merged to `main` according to the
    current coordination issue. Treat theme tokens and theme selection as
    **in code**, but keep browser/device QA and production deployment as
    **unverified** until exact-SHA and live-host evidence is recorded.
  - The oversized black `Guild / Sanctuary / Community Activity` area reported
    by the owner was not found in the checked-in shell/feed source inspected on
    2026-10-27. Before editing another component blindly, verify the live
    deployment commit and capture which route/component renders that area.
  - `package.json` — `"name": "guild-sanctuary"` is internal only; rename when
    convenient, not urgent.
  - Documentation headings still say "Guild Sanctuary" in places.
- The brand should be quiet and warm: sun/light imagery, green and gold, no
  hype language. "Guild" implied a game faction; "Sanctuary" implies safety.

## 2. Product principles

1. **Connection first, content second, commerce last.** Tokens buy expression,
   never reach, status, or another person's attention.
2. **Personal growth inside a social environment.** The point is to grow with
   people, not alone and not in competition.
3. **Nobody should feel alone here.** The default emotional tone is warmth,
   honesty, and permission to be unfinished.
4. **Positivity without fakery.** People can share hard days; the community
   responds with care, not performative positivity.
5. **Mental wellbeing sits beside spirituality.** Reflection, mood, grief,
   burnout, and everyday mental health are in scope. Diagnosis and treatment
   are not.
6. **Wisdom is free.** Members share life lessons and practice through posts,
   replies, and circles at no cost. Paid guides are a future option, not a
   gate on community support.
7. **Privacy is a feature.** Private by default for sensitive self-knowledge;
   explicit sharing only.
8. **No anonymous posting for now.** Guest mode is read-only and is enough.
   Members post under their account. Revisit only with a real safety design.
9. **Calm technology.** No infinite scroll pressure, no streak punishment, no
   public follower leaderboards, no ads in vulnerable spaces.
10. **Small and trustworthy beats large and opaque.** Prefer curated guides,
    small circles, and explainable moderation.

## 3. Decisions locked on 2026-10-27

| Area | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Name | The Sanctuary only; retire Guild branding in the UI and docs |
| Relationships | **Friend** (mutual, request/accept) and **follow** (one-way). One-way relationships are allowed. |
| Anonymous posting | Not now. Guest mode remains read-only. |
| Practices and guides | In scope. Free wisdom sharing first; guide account monetisation is a future option. |
| Focus | Personal growth in a social environment; spiritual *and* mental wellbeing; positivity and emotional honesty |
| Self-knowledge | Derive insight from details the member provides (birthday → star sign; likes/dislikes; personality questionnaire; optional body metrics) |
| Personality typing | Use a 16-type style questionnaire, described as a self-reflection profile — **not** official MBTI and not clinical |
| Dark mode | Wanted as soon as possible, with a theme system designed for future themes/flavours |
| Commerce | Tokens stay cosmetic-only; no gifts, transfers, trading, marketplace, or cash-out |
| Guest mode | Read-only; no posting, spending, or DMs |
| Moderation hierarchy | Strict rank hierarchy applies to account and content actions; no self-targeting; actor must strictly outrank target/owner; missing role/owner data fails closed; all actions require rationale and audit trail |

## 4. Workstreams

Workstreams are not strict phases; several can run in parallel. W1 is the
existing launch gate and must complete before any live payment.

### W0 — Identity and visual foundation (do first)

| Item | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rename the app shell to The Sanctuary | Planned | `ResponsiveShell.tsx` only code touchpoint |
| Fix shell contrast | Planned | Body is `#0a0a0a`, toolbar text `#4c5b50`/`#3f6049` outside the light surface; near-invisible |
| Single app shell | Planned | Remove the duplicate toolbar/header/nav layers |
| Theme token system | In code | Semantic CSS variables and global focus/reduced-motion styles added; CI and visual review pending |
| Dark mode | In code | Working theme application path and pre-render device storage bootstrap; CI and visual review pending |
| Theme presets and future flavours | In code, QA pending | Theme foundation includes Light, Dark, Dusk, and System options; verify the exact merged implementation and browser persistence before marking verified |
| Typography scale | In code, partial | Planner form controls are 15px, supporting copy 14px, and desktop navigation labels 14px; a whole-app typography pass and visual review remain planned |
| Component primitives | Planned | Button, Card, Dialog, Sheet, Tabs, Toast, EmptyState, Skeleton, Avatar, Badge |
| Navigation restructure | In code, partial | Desktop labels and touch targets improved; mobile fixed bottom tabs currently expose Today, Community, Discover, Messages, You with safe-area/content spacing. Circles and Practice destinations plus desktop rail redesign remain planned; browser/device QA pending |
| Feed polish | In code, partial | Relative/local post timestamps with exact local time available, readable post metadata, comment author IDs replaced by display names or a safe fallback, and Report moved into a compact post overflow menu; CI and browser QA pending |
| Event form fix | Planned | Replace raw latitude/longitude with place search, timezone, online/offline |

**Dark mode and theming design**

- Define tokens once: `--bg`, `--surface`, `--surface-raised`, `--ink`, `--muted`,
  `--line`, `--accent`, `--accent-contrast`, `--danger`, `--success`, radii,
  spacing, shadow, and motion duration.
- `:root` holds light; `[data-theme="dark"]` overrides. Use
  `color-scheme: light dark` correctly and stop the current mixed state where
  the page declares dark but renders a light surface.
- Profile accent (`--profile-accent`) stays separate from the app theme so a
  member's colour choice does not repaint the whole product.
- Persist theme choice in `account_settings.preferences` and mirror it locally
  to avoid a flash before settings load.
- Future themes should be data-driven presets (token maps), not new CSS files.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` and keep the existing Framer Motion
  `MotionConfig reducedMotion="user"`.

### W1 — Trust, safety, and launch gates (existing "Phase 1")

Status: **Partially in code; not verified end-to-end.** Check the current main-branch implementation and the release gates before treating any item as complete. The prior branch's `PHASE1_STAGING_CHECKLIST.md` is not present on main and is not a release approval.

- 18+ token purchase gate with server-side record
- Refund/chargeback clawback with manual review flags
- Seven-day account deletion grace, restore, and purge
- Terms acceptance version and timestamp, flag off until approved text
- Admin/moderation dashboard: reports, members, appeals, refund reviews, audit
- Strict account and content moderation hierarchy, self-target rejection, post-lock role rechecks, rationale validation, and audit logging (proposed in PR #81; not staging-verified)
- Member role changes lock actor/target rows before authorization and enforce strict hierarchy even for owner-to-owner changes (proposed in draft PR #84; not staging-verified)

Do not enable live checkout, ads, or the terms gate until the checklist has
actually run. This workstream is a hard gate, not a suggestion.

### W2 — Connection layer

| Item | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Notifications data model and in-app bell | In code, live event delivery unverified | Notification table/UI and read-state handling exist in the repository; live migration state and event delivery need owner/staging verification |
| Notification preferences | Planned | Per type and channel; quiet hours; digest |
| Email notifications | Planned | Daily/weekly digest; make the existing inert setting real |
| Web push + Android push | Planned | Requires a service worker; Capacitor push later |
| Follow (one-way) | Planned | `follows` table, follower/following lists, privacy control |
| Friend (mutual) | Planned | Request → accept/decline; `friendships` with status |
| Relationship-aware feed | Planned | Community / Friends / Following tabs, all reverse-chronological at first |
| Global search | Planned | People, posts, events, tags, practices; grouped results |
| Save / Keep | Planned | Private bookmarks for posts, events, practices, reflections |
| Share | Planned | External (Web Share API) and internal (send to DM) |
| Public URLs and previews | Planned | `/@username`, `/post/:id`, `/event/:id`; SSR metadata + Open Graph |
| Block / mute / restrict | Planned | Block prevents DMs and mutual visibility; mute hides; restrict hides comments |
| Message requests | Planned | Stranger DMs go to a request folder, not the inbox |
| Rich messaging | Planned | Read receipts, unread counts, typing, attachments, message search |
| Onboarding | Planned | Intention, interests, privacy defaults, safety briefing, display name |

**Relationship model**

- `follows(follower_id, followee_id, created_at)` — one-way, unique pair.
- `friendships(requester_id, addressee_id, status, created_at, responded_at)` —
  `pending` / `accepted` / `declined` / `blocked`. One row per pair; the pair is
  normalised so the same two people cannot create duplicates.
- Friend request and accept generate notifications.
- Blocking is separate and overrides both. A blocked person cannot follow,
  friend, message, or see the blocker's content.
- Show counts only as context ("12 friends"), never as a ranking.
- Privacy controls: who may follow (everyone / approved), who may friend
  (everyone / friends of friends / nobody), who may DM.

**Notification types (initial)**

- Social: follow, friend request, friend accept, like, comment, reply, mention
- Messaging: new DM, message request
- Community: circle invite, circle post, event reminder, event change
- Growth: daily prompt (opt-in), weekly reflection digest
- Account: moderation outcome, appeal outcome, token/refund outcome, security
- Never notify on every like by default; batch low-priority events.

### W3 — Personal growth and self-discovery

| Item | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Daily Planner + reflection | In code, QA pending | Tasks, habits, notes and daily reflection are grouped in the private planner; planner and reflection data remain browser-local and are not synced. Authenticated browser QA pending |
| Today home | Planned | Daily prompt, mood, one practice, one reflection, next circle |
| Mood/energy check-in | Planned | 10-second entry, private history, gentle patterns |
| Private journal | Planned | Prompts, tags, search, export, optional share-as-post |
| Self-discovery profile | Planned | See section 5 |
| Insights | Planned | Private patterns across mood, practice, sleep, and social energy |
| Gentle feed / content care | Planned | Sensitive tags, spoiler blur, hide debate/politics |
| Private milestones | Planned | Practice and journaling milestones visible only to the member |
| Life lessons format | Planned | A longer, structured post type: lesson, context, what helped |

**Life lessons** are the bridge between wisdom sharing and the feed. Suggest a
light structure (situation → what I learned → what helps now) but never force
it. They are normal posts with an optional template and tag, not a paywalled
product.

### W4 — Community, practices, and guides

| Item | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Circles | Planned | Small topic groups with named stewards and a member cap |
| Practice library | Planned | Guided meditation, breathwork, readings, journaling prompts |
| Practice sessions | Planned | Timer/player, completion, private history, optional circle check-in |
| Guides | Planned | Credibility label, tradition, disclosures, no medical claims |
| Live audio rooms | Planned | Meditation sits, talks, Q&A; audio-first, video later |
| Events upgrade | Planned | Place search, timezone, online option, capacity, host card |
| Circle safety | Planned | Clear norms, steward tools, report/escalate path |

**Circles** are the Discord-server/subreddit pattern sized for trust: 8–50
members, a topic, a named steward, and a pinned intention. Start with a small
curated set. Do not open public circle creation until moderation can cope.

**Practices** are first-party and curated. A practice has a title, intention,
duration, audio or text, tradition/source, and an optional guide. Free at
launch. Downloads and offline playback come with the service worker.

**Guides** are members with a verified credibility label, not a separate
account type at first. A guide profile adds tradition, training, disclosures,
and a statement of what they do not offer (medical or crisis care). Guide
monetisation is deferred; see W7.

### W5 — Wellbeing and safety maturity

| Item | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Crisis resources in-app | Planned | Persistent, quiet link in support, circles, and journal |
| Teen defaults | Planned | Stricter discovery, DMs, and spending for 13–17 |
| Suspended/banned appeals | Planned | Restricted sign-in state or out-of-band appeal form |
| Ban-evasion mitigation | Planned | Retain a hashed identifier through purge; manual re-registration review |
| Moderator wellbeing training | Planned | Self-harm, grief, abuse, exploitation, CSEA escalation |
| Transparency summary | Planned | Annual reports received/actioned/appealed |
| Peer-support boundaries | Planned | Listening, not therapy; clear escalation language |

Mental wellbeing is in scope, so the safety floor has to be higher than a
generic social app: no medical claims, no diagnosis, no crisis service
pretence, and a visible route to real help.

### W6 — Platform maturity

| Item | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Service worker / offline | Planned | Cache shell, journal, and practices |
| Push infrastructure | Planned | Web push + Capacitor push |
| Data export | Planned | GDPR portability; journal, posts, profile, wallet |
| Retention and deletion clarity | Planned | Show what is hidden, retained, and purged |
| i18n and RTL | Planned | Needed earlier if the audience is global |
| Passkeys and OAuth | Planned | Reduce OTP friction; keep TOTP |
| Analytics and health dashboards | Planned | Privacy-respecting product metrics, no ad-tech profiling |
| Rate limiting and media scanning | Planned | Production hardening |

### W7 — Future monetisation (deferred)

| Item | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Guide subscriptions | Deferred | Optional paid offerings; community help stays free |
| Paid practices or courses | Deferred | Curated, clearly labelled, refundable per policy |
| 1:1 sessions | Deferred | Needs booking, safety, and refund design |
| Token cosmetics | In code, Unapplied | The only current sink; keep it that way |
| Gifts, VIP, post promotion | Deferred | Do not implement without explicit approval |
| Transfers, trading, marketplace, cash-out | Rejected | Keep rejected |

Rules for any future monetisation:

- Never paywall peer support, crisis content, or the ability to ask for help.
- Never sell reach or ranking.
- Prices and entitlements stay server-side.
- Refund clawback rules apply to any new paid product.
- A guide's paid offering must be separable from their free community presence.

## 5. Self-discovery and insight design

The goal is to give something back to the member from what they share, without
turning the profile into a horoscope gimmick or a medical chart.

### Inputs (all optional unless needed)

| Input | Source | Default visibility | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Birthday | Member | Private, or month/day only | Derive star sign; do not ask twice |
| Star sign | Derived | Public if birthday sharing is on | Never hand-enter a conflicting sign |
| Height / weight | Member | **Private only** | Self-tracking framing; no BMI labels |
| Likes / dislikes | Member | Public by choice | Tags and free text; used for circles and people suggestions |
| Values | Member | Public by choice | e.g. honesty, family, nature, service |
| Personality questionnaire | Member | Private by default | 16-type style, shareable summary |
| Energy rhythm | Derived from check-ins | Private | "Morning / evening" patterns, no judgement |
| Practice interests | Member | Public by choice | Meditation, breathwork, journaling, philosophy |

### Outputs

- Star sign description written as reflection prompts, not predictions.
- Personality profile with strengths, stressors, and how the member likes to
  communicate; clearly labelled as self-reflection, not a diagnosis.
- Suggested practices based on stated interests and mood patterns.
- Suggested circles and people based on values, interests, and mutual friends.
- Private insight cards: "You tend to check in lower on Sundays", "You finish
  more practices in the morning" — with an easy way to turn insights off.

### Guardrails

- **Birthday:** storing a full date of birth is sensitive. Prefer storing
  month/day plus an optional year, or derive and store only the sign. The 18+
  purchase gate keeps its own verification record.
- **Height and weight:** do not compute or display BMI, "ideal" weight, or
  calorie targets. Do not show body metrics publicly. Offer a hide option and
  make the feature adult-only if it ships at all. This needs a wellbeing review
  before implementation.
- **Personality:** do not use "MBTI" as an official label unless licensed.
  Call it a "16-type personality profile". Do not use results for moderation,
  advertising, ranking, or matching that could disadvantage someone.
- **Quiz data:** answers are private, retakeable, exportable, and deletable.
- **No predictions, no certainty.** Language is "some people find", "you might
  notice", never "you are" or "this will happen".
- **No public scores.** No attractiveness, mental-health, or compatibility
  score visible to others.

### Suggested implementation order

1. Birthday → derived star sign, with privacy controls.
2. Likes/dislikes/values tags on the profile.
3. 16-type questionnaire with a private result and optional summary card.
4. Private insight cards from check-ins.
5. Gentle suggestions (practices, circles, people).

## 6. Comparison findings adopted into this roadmap

The 2026-10-27 platform comparison reviewed Meta, TikTok, X, Reddit, Discord,
WhatsApp/Telegram, YouTube, MySpace, Patreon/Substack, Meetup, Insight Timer,
Calm, and 7 Cups. The findings that shaped this roadmap:

- **Adopted:** notifications, social graph, global search, saved items,
  sharing, block/mute, public pages, rich messaging, circles, live audio,
  guide credibility, mood/journal, push, offline, data export.
- **Adapted:** "followers" → friend + follow; "streaks" → gentle return;
  "creator monetisation" → deferred guide offerings; "anonymous" → rejected
  for now; "algorithmic feed" → community/friends/following tabs.
- **Rejected:** public vanity rankings, infinite feed pressure, gifting and
  creator rankings, over-customised profiles, ads in vulnerable spaces.

The full gap analysis lives in the session report and is summarised here; it is
not a separate permanent document.

## 7. Deliberately out of scope

- Anonymous or throwaway posting (revisit only with a safety design).
- Live video streaming (audio rooms first).
- Token transfers, trading, marketplace, cash-out, gifts, VIP, post promotion.
- Public follower leaderboards or engagement scores.
- Medical, therapeutic, or diagnostic claims.
- Advertising inside journal, circles, or crisis surfaces.
- Under-13 accounts.
- Official MBTI branding.
- A recommendation algorithm that optimises time-on-app.

## 8. Open questions for the product owner

1. Should new members follow the whole community by default, or start empty?
2. Can strangers send friend requests, or only follow first?
3. Do we store a full birthday, month/day, or only the derived star sign?
4. Should height/weight ship at all, and should it be 18+ and private-only?
5. How long should the personality questionnaire be (10, 20, or 40 questions)?
6. Should personality results be shareable as a profile card?
7. What is the first set of circles (grief, meditation, philosophy, creativity,
   sobriety, parenthood)?
8. Who are the first guides, and what evidence earns the label?
9. Should guides be able to accept tips before subscriptions exist?
10. Which theme presets ship first (Light, Dark, Dusk, High contrast)?
11. What is the first public URL shape: `/@name`, `/u/name`, or `/members/name`?
12. When do teen defaults become a launch requirement?

## 9. Change log

- **2026-10-27** — Roadmap created. Locked naming, friend + follow
  relationships, no anonymous posting, free wisdom with future guide
  monetisation, spiritual + mental wellbeing focus, self-discovery inputs, and
  dark mode with theming. Recorded comparison findings and UI fixes.
- **2026-10-27** — Locked moderation policy: self-targeting is prohibited;
  actors must strictly outrank account/content owners; unknown role or owner
  data fails closed; owner role changes cannot target an equal-ranked owner.
  PR #81 contains the moderation proposal and PR #84 the role-change race fix;
  both remain unapplied pending staging/concurrency tests and independent review.


## 10. Competitive research and product learning

The owner asked for a comparison against real-world apps and platforms. Treat this as ongoing product research, not a mandate to copy competitors. Record findings and sources in a dated report under `docs/reports/`, then summarise accepted product implications here.

### Comparison set

- **Community and conversation:** Discord, Reddit, Facebook Groups, WhatsApp, Mighty Networks.
- **Identity, discovery, and creator ecosystems:** Instagram, YouTube, Twitch, Patreon.
- **Habits, reflection, and wellbeing:** Finch, Daylio, Headspace, Duolingo, Habitica.
- **Play, belonging, and creation:** Roblox, Steam.
- **Personal knowledge and organisation:** Notion.

For each platform, compare concrete user journeys and publicly documented capabilities: onboarding, discovery, social graph, group/community structure, messaging, creation tools, accessibility, privacy controls, moderation/reporting/blocking, safety for vulnerable users, notification pressure, monetisation, portability/deletion, platform constraints, and known user complaints. Separate verified facts, source-backed criticism, and the team's hypotheses. Prefer official product/help/privacy documents and current high-quality reporting; use community feedback as qualitative evidence rather than universal truth.

### Sanctuary differentiation guardrails

- Borrow useful patterns only when they reinforce growth with people, free community wisdom, emotional honesty, optional/private self-discovery, calm technology, privacy, and explainable safety.
- Do not introduce infinite-scroll pressure, streak punishment, public vanity leaderboards, selling reach, paid access to core peer support, manipulative notifications, or medical/diagnostic claims.
- Every proposed competitor-inspired feature must include member benefit, likely harms, privacy/safety impact, accessibility, engineering cost, success measure, and a decision of adopt / adapt / defer / reject.
- Keep the core community and safety experience useful without purchases. Tokens remain cosmetic-only.

## 11. Phase 1 execution and exit criteria

Phase 1 is the trust/safety launch gate in W1. It is **not complete** merely because code, a branch, or a checklist exists. Current status remains partially implemented and not end-to-end verified until evidence is attached.

### Parallel work packages

| Work package | Owner lane | Branch / anchor | Completion evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P1-A: visual foundation and accessible shell | Product & Experience | Existing PR #69, `build/roadmap-theme-foundation-2026-10-27` | CI for exact head, reviewed diff, browser/device checks; no claim of deploy until observed |
| P1-B: trust and safety | Engineering & Reliability | Existing PR #18, `feature/phase1-trust-safety` (verify live head before work) | Unit/integration tests plus `PHASE1_STAGING_CHECKLIST.md` executed against disposable staging |
| P1-C: operating model and agent handoff | Roadmap & Integration | `build/phase1-agent-coordination-2026-10-27` | Agent rules, ownership, acceptance criteria, and reports available to all supported coding agents |
| P1-D: independent review | Separate reviewer agent | Branch/PR chosen after P1-B diff inventory | Review findings and resolutions recorded; security-sensitive changes not self-approved |

### Phase 1 release gate

Before any release is called Phase 1 complete, verify: age eligibility is enforced server-side; terms version/time acceptance is recorded while the gate stays off until approved legal text; deletion request, restore, and purge respect the seven-day grace and authorization checks; refund/dispute processing is idempotent and never creates an automatic negative wallet balance; admin/moderation actions enforce role boundaries and audit events; migration state matches the target staging database; CI and security acceptance tests pass on the exact revision; backup/restore and rollback are understood; and a human owner approves the release.

Until these criteria pass, keep live checkout, ads, mandatory Terms gate, and production migrations disabled. If staging access or secrets are unavailable, mark the item **Blocked** and leave a precise safe next action. Do not represent a local build as end-to-end verification.

## 12. Multi-agent development rules

The authoritative operating model is `docs/AI_AGENT_OPERATING_MODEL.md`; all agents must read it through `AGENTS.md` and their platform entry file. Product & Experience and Engineering & Reliability may run in parallel only when file ownership and dependencies are separated. The roadmap coordinator owns canonical roadmap, blueprint, handoff, and agent-rule updates. Each task uses its own branch and focused PR; security-sensitive changes require an independent review. Keep The 5 Sleeves Online/2D and The 5 Sleeves 3D aligned to this roadmap through explicit contracts and separate repository work.


## Verified delivery checkpoint — 2026-10-27

- **Merged to `main`:** PR #157, commit `6deb72e684f237020458d5bfdeca3dd6a5bdb739`. Includes moving Daily Reflection into Personal Planner, mobile primary navigation, desktop navigation polish, community-feed improvements, and added regression contracts.
- **Checks:** CI / build-and-deploy workflow and contract checks passed on PR #157's recorded head. Cloudflare production deployment was skipped. Vercel reported the daily deployment quota limit; no new production deployment is claimed.
- **Not release-verified:** authenticated browser/device QA, account-switch testing, mobile accessibility checks, and Phase 1 staging checklist remain outstanding. Planner/reflection data are browser-local, not cloud-synced.
- **Open follow-up stack:** PRs #158–#170 remain separate, mostly stacked draft work for notification UX, reflection export/storage safety, account-switch isolation, messaging RPC contracts, and E2EE readiness documentation. Check exact current heads and dependencies before merging; do not claim messaging is end-to-end encrypted.
- **Superseded/overlapping drafts:** PR #155 (move Daily Reflection to planner) and #156 (planner/theme contract coverage) overlap changes now included in #157; review and close as superseded once their unique diffs are confirmed absent.
- **Owner-only provider work:** Supabase, Stripe, Lemon Squeezy, Cloudflare, and Vercel account configuration/migrations/secrets remain explicit owner handoff tasks. Do not change provider configuration or enable checkout as part of code cleanup.
- **Next release gate:** integrate the remaining stack in dependency order, re-run CI against each final head, then complete authenticated two-account and device/browser QA. Phase 1 remains not end-to-end verified.

## Integration and release checkpoint — 2026-10-27 (latest)

### Merged to `main`
The following PRs are merged and present in the current mainline: #157–#170. The integration sequence covered responsive navigation/feed polish; notification accessibility and event-time clarity; private self-discovery export and session-state cleanup; an explicit end-to-end encryption readiness plan; notification action/session guards; static messaging RPC security contracts; message-thread and inbox account isolation; event and planner account isolation; fail-closed local reflection storage; and account-settings isolation. PR #155 and #156 were closed as superseded because their unique file changes were included in #157.

### Verification and deployment
- Integration commit after PR #170 merged (before memory-document commits): `d101c2dcf504fae4b8aa54855e293acd77b69700`.
- Mainline CI passed: run [40587495814](https://github.com/platinumsoundz/Guild-Sanctuary/actions/runs/40587495814).
- Automated roadmap/build check passed: run [40587495899](https://github.com/platinumsoundz/Guild-Sanctuary/actions/runs/40587495899).
- The repository's Cloudflare deployment workflow completed successfully: run [40587495817](https://github.com/platinumsoundz/Guild-Sanctuary/actions/runs/40587495817). This records workflow success, not a substitute for authenticated browser/device verification.
- Vercel had previously reported its daily deployment quota limit on preview checks. Do not treat that as a failure of the mainline CI or as proof of Vercel production deployment.

### Remaining release gates
- Authenticated browser/device QA is still outstanding: test account switching and isolation for settings, planner, reflections, events, inbox, message threads, and notification actions; verify mobile navigation, keyboard/focus behavior, event timezone display, and reflection storage-denial recovery.
- Messaging remains **not end-to-end encrypted**. The merged readiness document is a plan/gate, not cryptographic implementation. Static messaging contract checks do not prove live Supabase RLS/RPC authorization; two-account staging tests are required.
- Planner, daily reflection, and self-discovery answers/results remain browser-local/session-only as documented; do not describe them as account-synced or cloud-backed.
- Phase 1 is not end-to-end verified until the staging checklist, safety authorization tests, backup/restore and rollback review, and human release approval are complete.

### Open draft work to triage
- #145 — database-backed Daily Reflection recovery: review carefully against the now-merged local-only reflection implementation before integrating; it may change storage/privacy assumptions.
- #122 — guarded token-shop spending plus its merged static contract check: remains a draft; require full CI on the final feature head and live authorization/ledger tests before enabling spending.
- #84 and #81 — member-role authorization and moderation hierarchy: security-sensitive; require independent review and staging authorization tests.
- #85 — beta showcase collaboration; validate feature scope and safety before promotion.
- #5 — game wallet bridge; check compatibility with the token wallet/ledger and keep any spending/transfer claims disabled until verified.

### Owner-only provider handoff
Supabase schema/migrations/RLS and owner bootstrap; Stripe and Lemon Squeezy payment setup; Cloudflare/Vercel account settings, secrets, domains and provider configuration remain owner tasks. The successful Cloudflare workflow was the repository's existing automated release path; no provider account settings or secrets were edited in this cleanup.

## Continued cleanup checkpoint — 2026-10-27

### Mainline and draft status
- Mainline contains the merged privacy/reliability stack #157–#170. The preceding roadmap/recovery checkpoint commit is `aa70be864d8471aeb6af58fab010f758d4514415`; its CI run [40591789913](https://github.com/platinumsoundz/Guild-Sanctuary/actions/runs/40591789913), roadmap/build check [40591789891](https://github.com/platinumsoundz/Guild-Sanctuary/actions/runs/40591789891), and Cloudflare workflow [40591789945](https://github.com/platinumsoundz/Guild-Sanctuary/actions/runs/40591789945) all passed. This documentation commit follows that checkpoint.
- Latest mainline CI, roadmap/build check, and repository Cloudflare deployment workflow passed on the pre-checkpoint mainline. Authenticated browser/device QA is still outstanding; workflow success alone is not proof of user-level acceptance.
- PR #145 (private database-backed Daily Reflection) has now been reconciled onto current main. Its CI, Daily Reflection contract, and dependency-map contract passed on head `b68da680269498b43a30e62635ce6e2848a3bd78`. It remains draft: the owner must approve the storage transition and apply the migration through the approved Supabase workflow, then run authenticated cross-account and failure-path tests. Do not merge/apply automatically.
- PR #122 (token redemption) now includes the token-spend contract from #124, rebased onto current main and merged into its draft branch at `f635b54712df8c3f8c520c2668d39c5a623c5b6a`. The purchase handler and buttons explicitly remain locked with `SPENDING_ENABLED = false`; CI [40591929788](https://github.com/platinumsoundz/Guild-Sanctuary/actions/runs/40591929788), dependency-map [40591929744](https://github.com/platinumsoundz/Guild-Sanctuary/actions/runs/40591929744), roadmap/build [40591929814](https://github.com/platinumsoundz/Guild-Sanctuary/actions/runs/40591929814), and Cloudflare workflow [40591929809](https://github.com/platinumsoundz/Guild-Sanctuary/actions/runs/40591929809) all passed on that exact feature head. Do not enable spending until the owner-approved migration and isolated staging ledger/authorization matrix pass.
- PR #124 was merged into PR #122's feature branch only (merge commit `f635b54712df8c3f8c520c2668d39c5a623c5b6a`) and is closed as merged; this did **not** merge token spending to `main`.
- PR #81 moderation hierarchy is rebased on current main at `3f113c7612eb5c0282512d705e7302aa2dda74d2`; CI, moderation contract, dependency-map and repository workflow checks passed. PR #84 member-role locking is rebased at `a4e816100e8a31a44c45c0ddf28769b79492bc3d`; CI, role-lock contract, dependency-map and repository workflow checks passed. Both remain draft because SQL migrations are not applied and independent staging/concurrency tests and security review are still required.
- PR #85 beta showcase remains non-mergeable and draft; reconcile its broad overlapping changes before promotion. PR #5 game-wallet bridge remains draft on a separate feature base and is blocked on migration/schema reconciliation and scoped game-ticket staging tests.

### Release gates and owner handoff
- Do not enable token spending, game-credit transfers, checkout, ads, mandatory Terms gating, or production migrations merely because source checks pass.
- Supabase schema/migrations/RLS/owner bootstrap, Stripe and Lemon Squeezy payment setup, and Cloudflare/Vercel account configuration, secrets, domains and provider settings remain owner-only handoff tasks. No provider account settings were changed in this cleanup.
- Messaging is not end-to-end encrypted. The readiness document is a plan only. Planner/reflection/self-discovery data must not be described as cloud-synced until the approved database work is applied and tested.
- Phase 1 remains **not end-to-end verified** until the staging checklist, authenticated two-account tests, browser/device QA, backup/restore and rollback review, independent security review, and owner release approval are recorded.
